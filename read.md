Working until now 
It is enough 


clone remote repositories from https://github.com/Niryork/Manager.git to local dir
add file or dir use :git add file/dirname
commit to  repositories use :git commit -m "Messeage"



first git remote add origin https://github.com/Niryork/Manager.git

then push to remote  repositories use :git push -u origin master
